## ABOUT
SpaceEZ is an open-source Python library to allow easy access to Junos Space REST API services for Python developers. The design of the library closely follows the hierarchical structure of Junos Space REST API and provides minimum learning curve for Python developers to be able to utilize these APIs. This library also strives to minimize:
* the effort required to create Python programs that interact with Junos Space using REST APIs. 
* the number of lines of Python code required to create such programs and thus makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain them.
